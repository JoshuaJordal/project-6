Rules:
When a distance in kilometers is divided by a speed in kilometers per hour, the result is a time measured in hours. For example, a distance of 100 km divided by a speed of 15 km per hour results in a time of 6.666666... hours. To convert that figure into hours and minutes, subtract the whole number of hours (6) and multiply the resulting fractional part by 60. The result is 6 hours, 40 minutes, expressed here as 6H40.

The calculator converts all inputs expressed in units of miles to kilometers and rounds (April 2021) truncates the result to the nearest kilometer before being used in calculations. Times are rounded to the nearest minute.
